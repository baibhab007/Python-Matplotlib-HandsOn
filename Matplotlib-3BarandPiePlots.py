Writing Functions
Complete the following function definitions, defined in Matsession/tests/test_plots.py, based on the instructions provided:

1. test_barplot_of_iris_sepal_length

Create a figure of size 8 inches in width, and 6 inches in height. Name it as fig.

Create an axis, associated with figure fig, using add_subplot. Name it as ax.

Define a list species, with elements ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'viriginica'].

Define a list index, with values [0.2, 1.2, 2.2].

Define another list sepal_len with values [5.01, 5.94, 6.59]. These values represent the mean sepal length of iris flowers belonging to three species.

Draw a bar plot using the bar function, such that the height of each vertical bar displays the sepal length of a species.

Use index and sepal_len as variables. Set bar width as 0.5, color as red, and border color of the bar as black.

Label X-Axis as Species.

Label Y-Axis as Sepal Length (cm).

Set Title as Mean Sepal Length of Iris Species.

Limit X-Axis from 0 to 3.

Limit Y-Axis from 0 to 7.

Set ticks on X-Axis at 0.45, 1.45, and 2.45.

Set X-Axis tick labels to ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'viriginica']
